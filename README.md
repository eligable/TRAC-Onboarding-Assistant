## 📖 About This App

**TRAC Onboarding Assistant** is an AI-powered interactive chatbot that guides new users through the TRAC ecosystem step-by-step. Unlike other forks that only show balance or basic info, this app focuses on **education and engagement** — turning confused newcomers into confident TRAC users.

### Why This App?

The biggest barrier to TRAC adoption is the learning curve. New users don't know:
- What TRAC actually is
- How to set up a wallet
- How IntercomSwap works
- What TNK tokenomics look like

This assistant solves all of that in one place with a beautiful, interactive interface.
